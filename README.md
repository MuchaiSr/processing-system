# processing-system
This is a simple processing system that is meant to simulate the entire process that occurs when an order is placed. It is meant to record my learning process as it does not actually do anything when the button is clicked. I took in this little project so that I could learn how Promises work and as of 20th March 2025, this is what I have come up with. I hope to implement more features for this processing system in the future once I learn a bit more.
