# processing-system
This folder has two files, one has a simple processing system that is meant to simulate the entire process that occurs when an order is placed and the other file that is primarily meant for asynchronous functions. It is meant to record my learning process as it does not actually do anything when the button is clicked. I hope to implement more features in the future once I learn a bit more.
